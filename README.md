## Project Journey

### Why I Made This Project

I was constantly screenshotting lyrics and saving them in random notes apps with no way to organize or find them later. I needed a personal, private space to save meaningful lyrics with my own thoughts and organize them by mood or theme. LyricJournal became my solution - a simple, beautiful way to curate the lyrics that matter most to me.

### How I Made This Project

1. **Planning** - Designed a clean, mobile-first interface with warm colors
2. **Backend** - Built Node.js/Express API with JWT authentication and file-based storage
3. **Frontend** - Used vanilla JavaScript and custom CSS for performance
4. **Features** - Started basic (CRUD), then added search, tags, and filtering
5. **Deployment** - Deployed to Render with mobile optimization

### What I Struggled With and Learned

**Biggest Struggles:**
- **Tag System** - Balancing predefined vs custom tags, handling variations
- **Mobile UX** - Making tag selection and modals work on touch devices  
- **State Management** - Managing app state without a framework

**Key Learnings:**
- Start simple, then enhance - basic CRUD first, features second
- Mobile-first design is essential for apps people use on-the-go
- Vanilla JavaScript teaches you fundamentals that frameworks abstract away
- User authentication adds significant complexity but is worth it for privacy
- File-based storage is perfect for small personal projects
